The file run_analysis.R contains the script that creates a tidy dataset from
the activity recognition dataset. In order to run the script, a folder called
'UCI HAR Dataset' must be in the same directory, containing the training and 
test cases. The script loads the data, extracts the relevant features, renames 
the activities and calculates averages for each feature given the subject and 
type of activity. The file CodeBook.md contains the description of the variables 
in the tidy dataset and the performed transformations
